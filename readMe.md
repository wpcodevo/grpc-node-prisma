# Build a Complete CRUD gRPC API with Node.js and Express

In this guide, you will learn how to build a complete CRUD gRPC API server and client with TypeScript in a Node.js environment that runs on an Expressjs framework and uses a Prisma database ORM. We'll create five RPC services on the gRPC server that are going to be evoked by the gRPC client to perform the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.
